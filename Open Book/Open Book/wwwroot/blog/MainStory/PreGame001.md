My name is Winter and sometimes I review books and other things on social media. Some friends encouraged me to put a little bit more effort into those reviews so I've added this blog to my site.

In my day to day life i'm a file clerk, though my education is a bachelers degree in comp-sci. Thats why I maintain this website and do some other web-dev things on the side. I also maintain a CV on this website so you can have a look at that if you want to know more.

Open Book will include reviews of science fiction, fantasy and detective ficiton. But also technical literature if I feel like it. I can do both.

Also I might ramble about my life a bit from time to time. Lifestyle blogging is a thing.

Please look around and return if that seems like a thing you might enjoy.
