So if you looked around you probably noticed Open Book has some things that have nothing to do with a review and lifestyle blog. I've said in my very first blog update that I'm a comp-sci major and so I like to do programming things as a hobby.

First of all my CV is on here because thats a good thing to have ready and up to date. And the gear and such things are there for anytime people ask me what I'm using.

I'm also planning on adding things like a Todo list for reviews and such so people know whats going to be coming in the future. And whatever else I fee like adding.
