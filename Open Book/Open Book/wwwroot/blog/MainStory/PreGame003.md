I got this weird book in the mail today. Not sure why or who sent it. Didn't have a return adress or sender on the packaging at all. Its a pretty chunky hardcover volume. Think uni hardcover textbook. I took it out of the mail packaging but not out of the plastic, nothing like a letter included either.

Strange now that I'm sat here writing this I can't remember the name of it or the author.

I know I said i'd review literature and I don't mine people sending me stuff but if you are going to send me something to review maybe send me an email or at least include a letter with it.

Anyway it was clearly sent to my place and legally that means its mine now so I can do whatever I want with it. Which is probably going to be to take it out of the plastic, crack it open ( but not the spine ) and see if I care about what its got to say. I'll keep you all updated.

## Here There will be A Button that says something like "Open The Book"
